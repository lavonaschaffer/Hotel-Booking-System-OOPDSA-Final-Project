# Hotel-Booking-System-OOPDSA-Final-Project
 The Hotel Booking Management System is a complete solution for owners and cus tomers to make and manage reservations, finding personalized accommodation op tions through various search options.
 
 In this project, we aim to create a simplified experience of the hotel booking management system, with the main focus on the customer side. The system will provide a friendly user interface and good 
 search engines, including options for deep filters such as number of people, location, and price range,... for customers to find relevant accommodation options, and compare prices among selections.
 In the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structure Algorithm course, the project will be created using Java, and will focus on designing classes and data structures to efficiently 
 store accommodation data, and user query data. Moreover, the project aims to provide a fast and reliable search algorithm for users to get the most relevant options
